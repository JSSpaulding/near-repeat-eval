Evaluation of Near Repeat Analysis Parameters and Methods

Project to assess the degree to which cities of different scale experience near repeat crime patterns. 
The 3D surfaces are empirically created to define optimized parameters for the spatio-temporal clustering of crime incidents.
Near repeat linked crime incidents can then be modelled in a network to illustrate the interrelationship among the incidents.
